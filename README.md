This repository is a collection of tutorials for [MIT Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/) courses. More added as courses progress.

## Tutorial: Deep Learning Basics

This tutorial accompanies the [lecture on Deep Learning Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf&v=O5xeyoRL95U). It presents several concepts in deep learning, demonstrating the first two (feed forward and convolutional neural networks) and providing pointers to tutorials on the others. This is a good place to start.

## DeepTraffic Deep Reinforcement Learning Competition

<a href="https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic"><img src="images/thumb_deeptraffic.gif"></a>

DeepTraffic is a deep reinforcement learning competition. The goal is to create a neural network that drives a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) as fast as possible through dense highway traffic.
