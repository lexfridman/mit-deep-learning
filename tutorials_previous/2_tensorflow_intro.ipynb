    "TensorFlow is a general-purpose system for graph-based computation. A typical use is machine learning. In this notebook, we'll introduce the basic concepts of TensorFlow using some simple examples.\n",

    "TensorFlow gets its name from [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor), which are arrays of arbitrary dimensionality. A vector is a 1-d array and is known as a 1st-order tensor. A matrix is a 2-d array and a 2nd-order tensor. The \"flow\" part of the name refers to computation flowing through a graph. Training and inference in a neural network, for example, involves the propagation of matrix computations through many nodes in a computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of doing things in TensorFlow, you might want to think of creating tensors (like matrices), adding operations (that output other tensors), and then executing the computation (running the computational graph). In particular, it's important to realize that when you add an operation on tensors, it doesn't execute immediately. Rather, TensorFlow waits for you to define all the operations you want to perform. Then, TensorFlow optimizes the computation graph, deciding how to execute the computation, before generating the data. Because of this, a tensor in TensorFlow isn't so much holding the data as a placeholder for holding the data, waiting for the data to arrive when a computation is executed."

    "This import brings TensorFlow's public API into our IPython runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    ">`with tf.Session():`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run an operation in TensorFlow, you need to do it in the context of a `Session`. A session holds the computation graph, which contains the tensors and the operations. When you create tensors and operations, they are not executed immediately, but wait for other operations and tensors to be added to the graph, only executing when finally requested to produce the results of the session. Deferring the execution like this provides additional opportunities for parallelism and optimization, as TensorFlow can decide how to combine operations and where to run them after TensorFlow knows about all the operations. \n",
    "\n",
    ">>`input1 = tf.constant([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0])`\n",
    "\n",
    ">>`input2 = tf.constant([2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0])`\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two lines create tensors using a convenience function called `constant`, which is similar to numpy's `array` and numpy's `full`. If you look at the code for `constant`, you can see the details of what it is doing to create the tensor. In summary, it creates a tensor of the necessary shape and applies the constant operator to it to fill it with the provided values. The values to `constant` can be Python or numpy arrays. `constant` can take an optional shape parameter, which works similarly to numpy's `fill` if provided, and an optional name parameter, which can be used to put a more human-readable label on the operation in the TensorFlow operation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>`output = tf.add(input1, input2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think `add` just adds the two vectors now, but it doesn't quite do that. What it does is put the `add` operation into the computational graph. The results of the addition aren't available yet. They've been put in the computation graph, but the computation graph hasn't been executed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>`result = output.eval()`\n",
    "\n",
    ">>`print result`\n",
    "\n",
    "`eval()` is also slightly more complicated than it looks. Yes, it does get the value of the vector (tensor) that results from the addition. It returns this as a numpy array, which can then be printed. But, it's important to realize it also runs the computation graph at this point, because we demanded the output from the operation node of the graph; to produce that, it had to run the computation graph. So, this is the point where the addition is actually performed, not when `add` was called, as `add` just put the addition operation into the TensorFlow computation graph."

    "This is more complicated. At a high level, we create two variables and add operations over them, then, in a loop, repeatedly execute those operations. Let's walk through it step by step.\n",

    "Starting off, the code creates two variables, `total` and `weights`. `total` is initialized to \\[0, 0\\] and `weights` is initialized to random values between -1 and 1.\n",

Again, the operators are not executed here. In fact, this isn't even inside the loop. We won't execute these operations until the `eval` call inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the for loop, we run each of the operators. In each iteration of the loop, this executes the operators we added earlier, first putting random values into the weights, then updating the totals with the new weights. This call uses `eval` on the session; the code also could have called `eval` on the operators (e.g. `update_weights.eval`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a little hard to wrap your head around exactly what computation is done when. The important thing to remember is that computation is only performed on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be useful in cases where you have a large amount of computation and data that you want to use over and over again with just a minor change to the input each time. That happens quite a bit with neural networks, for example, where you just want to update the weights each time you go through the batches of input data, then run the same operations over again."
